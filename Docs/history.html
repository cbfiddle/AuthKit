If it's not, arbitrary programs might berun as root, often with dire consequences.Securing the app-bundle is pivotal,and all the necessary steps and safeguards may not be obvious.<p>It would be nice if I could provide a GUI demo app.I probably won't provide one, though, unless it's very simple or specialized.One problem with simple or specialized apps is that they often don'tillustrate or exemplify real-world security procedures or techniques.The simplicity that makes them understandable as illustrationslimits the kind of security capabilities they can illustrate.As a result, approaches which are adequate for a simple taskmay be mistaken as the be-all and end-allof security, and are then copied in places where they are inadequateor entirely wrong.This is actually a danger of any kind of security example, not just simple ones.Let's face it, if good computer security were easy, it would happen more often.The fact that it doesn't happen more often should illustrate its difficulty,even for engineers who regularly eat other kinds of complexity for breakfast.<ul type="disc"><li><b>MacOSXAuthorization</b> is the principal concrete implementation.It uses JNI and requires a Mach-O native library (supplied in pre-compiled form).It has been tested under J2SE 1.3.1 and 1.4.1_01on Mac OS X 10.2.3.It should work on all the 10.2.* sub-versions, but this has not been tested.It should work as far back as 10.0, but this has not been tested.I don't know how far forward it will work (10.3 Panther preview?)because it has not been tested there.</li></ul></font></blockquote><hr size="10"  width="95%"><blockquote><a href="http://www.amug.org/~glguerin/index.html">ToGreg's Home Page</a><br><a href="http://www.amug.org/~glguerin/sw/index.html">ToGreg's Software Page</a></blockquote></body></html>
